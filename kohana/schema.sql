She quickly found it was difficult to find cute, basic, comfortable, affordable shirts for little girls. She was always searching and searching for high quality shirts with basic colors and styles without any frills, crazy designs, or decorations on them and in small sizes. Wow! This was a full time job in itself. She searched department stores, retail stores, and on-line and came up with nothing. That is when she, along with her sister, decided they should spend her time designing and creating these shirts instead of spending time searching for them. This was the beginning of Royal Spice Clothing.    \r\n\r\nThey began in 2006 testing fabrics, measuring, creating size charts for their Shadow Shirt Collection line. This was an intense process of designing, creating samples and fitting all the shirts on babies and children to make sure the sizing was the best. Finally, they achieved their size chart goals and their Shadow Shirt Collection was born!','$6.49'),(62,'1 Day Sports','http://www.1daysports.com/','http://www.1daysports.com/','http://d3d71ba2asa5oz.cloudfront.net/22001014/images/nicprecserwset-eb0811.jpg','Jack Nicklaus 3 Piece Wedge Set','See description','2011-08-06','Manufactured by Nicklaus Golf, this Precision Series 3 piece wedge set features a low deep center of gravity for increased accuracy and forgiveness.

Never before has Canon equipped an ELPH with a back-illuminated CMOS sensor-driven HS SYSTEM or an f/2.0 lens - both of which deliver incredible images in low light. And shooting action or sporting events has never been so fun, with High-Speed Burst mode and the Super Slow Motion Movie function to mix things up. You\'ll control shots like a pro with Aperture- and Shutter-priority modes, and play your 720p HD movies effortlessly on your HDTV. All this from a super-slim style icon - what more could you ask?  A new 10.0 Megapixel CMOS sensor combined with the DIGIC 4 Image Processor create the Canon HS SYSTEM for improved low light performance and better image quality. The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low light shooting. The system delivers clear, blur-free shots with all the ambiance intact, and frees you from the sometimes unwanted effects of using the flash. Beautiful low light shots are possible at both low and high ISO speeds, and the dynamic range is expanded to retain maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in a compact PowerShot. The first is the 10.0 Megapixel CMOS Sensor, which positions the light-receiving surface for optimal light reception. More light means clearer, blur-free images with plenty of detail and nuance, even in dark areas. Working together with the CMOS sensor to deliver the HS SYSTEM is Canon\'s advanced DIGIC 4 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise and delivers high speed image processing. A bright f/2.0 lens, great for shooting in low light conditions or using a shallow depth-of-field for great images with beautiful soft backgrounds.The Canon PowerShot SD4000 IS Digital ELPH sports an f/2.0 aperture, perfect for creating enticing portraits, by drawing attention to the face and blurring the background with its impressively shallow depth-of-field. The Macro setting lets you get even closer. The large aperture also does more. It lets you capture more nuances in low light shooting by using more of the available light. You\'ll be ready for anything with a lens aperture larger than even many professional sizes. 720p HD movie shooting capability plus HDMI output connector for easy playback of video and photos on your HDTV.The Canon PowerShot SD4000 IS Digital ELPH lets you record video in beautiful 720p high definition (1280 x 720 pixels). The camera also makes it easy to enjoy HD movies (and still photos) on your HDTV with a mini-HDMI connector for direct connection to a high definition TV monitor. You\'ll enjoy the HD experience with no degradation of image or audio in the signal, plus the ability to display up to 130 still images at once. Shoot slow motion video with the Super Slow Motion Movie function or capture fast action shots with the High-Speed Burst mode.Give your movies a whole new look with the Super Slow Motion Movie function. Whether you\'re going for a dreamy, creative slant when documenting family moments, or making a highlight film of your kids\' greatest sports plays, you\'ll love the high quality capture of this all-new feature. The camera shoots your clips at high speed (approx. 240fps) and plays them back at 30fps for the inimitable super slow motion feeling you\'ll love. High-Speed Burst is exactly what you need when you\'re trying to capture the best possible shot within a moment of fast-moving action. In High-Speed Burst mode, the camera automatically shoots continuously at high speed (approx. 8.4fps)* while you simply hold down the shutter. The mode lets you shoot sporting events, kids in motion, wildlife and any situation with unpredictable movement, then simply choose the best shots captured.*Depending on the shooting conditions, camera settings and the zoom position, the shooting speed may slow down. As the number of images increases, the shooting interval may take longer. Bring creativity to your photos with new scene modes such as Miniature Effect and Fisheye Effect. Plus Low Light mode for dimly-lit situations.The Canon PowerShot SD4000 IS Digital ELPH offers creative effects similar to those found in certain professional lenses. Miniature Effect creates an illusion where very large objects appear in miniature proportions. Turn soaring cityscapes into a scene in seemingly dollhouse-like proportions. Fisheye Effect uses barrel distortion to warp the image around the center, giving a distinctive curvature effect to the photo. The curvilinear images produced by Fisheye Effect can suggest the curve of the Earth, the inside of a dome, or the image you see through the peephole of a door. With an ISO of 400 - 6400, the Low Light mode takes the Canon PowerShot SD4000 IS Digital ELPH where no ELPH Series has gone before - into the shadows! Now even scenes notorious for having insufficient light, such as those lit by candles, fire, or street lamp, come through in fantastic color and clarity, with less noise. You can keep the feel of the scene intact without adding additional light, so the result will be scenes with the visual accuracy, depth and clarity you expect from a Canon camera. Shooting ModesAdvanced presets for the best possible photos under certain conditions. With 23 Shooting Modes, you\'re ready for whatever shot comes your way. Shoot like a pro with Aperture- and Shutter-priority modes for extra control of your images.For photography enthusiasts, the ability to control aperture and shutter speed is key. The Aperture- and Shutter-priority modes on the Canon PowerShot SD4000 IS Digital ELPH make it easy for anyone to take extra control over the look and feel of images captured. In Aperture-priority mode, you set the aperture and the camera automatically selects an appropriate shutter speed. This lets you create sharp subjects with beautifully blurred backgrounds, and landscapes with foreground, middle ground and background all in focus. Shutter-priority mode lets you choose a shutter speed while the camera automatically selects the aperture. Higher shutter speeds are great for catching stop-action shots of moving subjects, while lower shutter speeds can create atmospheric blur.

Consulting oenologist Riccardo Cotarella oversees winemaking, but these delicious wines stand out for the qualities of the raw materials as much as they do for what goes on in the cellar.” – The Wine Advocate, April 2009\r\n\r\n\"For generations, the Sportoletti family has always also been passionately dedicated to producing wine in Umbria. At the end of the 1970s, brothers Ernesto and Remo decided to turn their attention exclusively to winemaking. With great reverence for the teachings of their father Vittorio, they began to bottle wines under their own label. From that point on, they began a long journey in pursuit of the perfect balance between innovation and tradition, endeavoring to unleash the full potential of their territory, situated on the hills between Spello and Assisi where they now own 20 hectares of vineyards from which they produce an average of 200,000 bottles per year.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1998, the company decided to join forces with the highly esteemed agronomic and oenological consultant Riccardo Cotarella, thus marking the start of a highly successful professional collaboration as well as a valued friendship. They regularly replant their vines and cultivate them using the spur pruning system and high density planting. With 5,000 vines per hectare, they are able to control the number of buds and consequently the productivity of the vines. For the reserve wines, a first harvest of the grapes is carried out while the grapes are just beginning to ripen, in order to obtain an average yield of 1 Kg of grapes per plant. Vines currently cultivated include the indigenous Grechetto, for which they chose the G5 clone, a lower yielding yet more characteristic strain. The Merlot they grow is a particular massale clone that was selected and propagated from an old vine that had been on the property for fifty years and which, over the years, has given rise to one of their most successful wines. Specific clones of Sangiovese that provide a lower yield but are much richer in color were also chosen, the same holding true for their Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.\" -Importer','23'),(121,'Copy Fax Deals','http://www.copyfaxdeals.com/','http://www.copyfaxdeals.com/','http://www.copyfaxdeals.com/images/big/lj4200.gif','HP Laser Jet 4200 Laser Printer','','2011-08-06','The HP LaserJet 4200 printer is the new standard for workgroup printing.

I’m the BBQ master. I will make anything and everything you desire. Just name it, burgers, dogs, chicken, fish, steak, kabobs, squirrel, it’s all the same to me because I put the same secret BBQ sauce on everything I cook. “What’s in it” you ask? I use a blend of herbs and spices past down from generation to generation. Word has it that my great greatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandfather invented the recipe himself and brought it to America when he sailed aboard the Mayflower. The recipe is a mix of peppermint, mustard seed, curry powder, vanilla extract, cumin, poppy seed, onion powder, avocado oil, molasses, and about 80 more ingredients.  I’m sorry, but I’m not able to give you exact proportions as it is a family secret. You understand, right? \r\nThere’s one side effect of eating my amazing barbeque sauce. You start doing the Latin Hustle. This side effect normally occurs 20 minutes after consumption and lasts 4-6 hours. It’s very strange that this happens but it really makes a great family BBQ. Everyone is always dancing and it happens in a very natural, organic way so no one is freaked out. Nobody realizes that there is a pattern at all my BBQ’s in which everyone breaks out and does the hustle. You know what the best part is? I don’t use a charcoal or gas grill.

It’s supper time.” That’s weird, I thought. For one, the last time I checked, it was noon. And secondly, my mother was in Cleveland visiting family. I looked down at my watch, and as I lifted it my arm to read it, the watch slipped off. The band was enormous. Wait—no, it wasn’t the band, it was my wrist! It was twice as small as usual. Then I realized I was in overalls! And my shoes lit up when they clicked together!\r\nI put it together quite quickly, I was having a psychotic episode and I had regressed back to my childhood.

Yes, I remember that the crotchety old watchmaker (who called watches “timepieces”—what a loser!) told me that this watch was special. He said, “Be warned, this watch is a time machine and I’m using you as an experiment to test its powers.” At the time, I figured he was a total whack-job. It seems that I was wrong. Or was I?\r\nThen I remembered something else. My therapist said, “Chris, you are on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Stop coming up with crazy stories about crotchety old watchmakers and time travel.” All of a sudden it became clear; I was simultaneously experiencing a nervous breakdown while entrenched in a time traveling disaster.Product Features:\r\nBrand: Seiko\r\nModel number: SNK809\r\nGender: Mens\r\nWatch Style: Casual\r\nMovement: Automatic\r\nFunctions: Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Calendar\r\nCase Material: Stainless Steel\r\nCase Shape: Round\r\nCase Diameter: 37 mm\r\nCase Thickness: 13 mm\r\nCase Back: Skeleton\r\nBezel: Fixed Stainless Steel\r\nDial Color: Black\r\nDial Type: Analog\r\nDial Markers: Arabic Numeral\r\nSubDials: Skeleton\r\nHands: Luminous\r\nLuminiscents: Hands and Markers\r\nBracelet: Black Canvas\r\nBand Width: 18.8 mm\r\nClasp: Tang\r\nCalendar: Day of the week and date display appears at the 3 o\'clock position\r\nCrystal: Hardlex What You Get:\r\nSeiko 5 Black Dial Black Canvas Strap Automatic Mens Watch SNK809\r\nNew Gift Box\r\n1 Year Warranty','$54.99'),(137,'Daily Steals Mobile','http://mobile.dailysteals.com/','http://mobile.dailysteals.com/','http://mobile.dailysteals.com/images/product/medium/1731.jpg','Logitech Harmony 650 Universal Remote with Color Screen â Replace Up To 5 Remotes','','2011-08-08','I finally did it, and it is AWESOME!\r\nAlright, so let me tell you about a little problem mixed in with a little pet peeve of mine. Where does the story start? Television. I\'ve got one, you\'ve got one, I don\'t need to explain what that is. But have you ever bought a fancy new television? I can\'t say I\'ve done that on many occasions, but sometimes I find myself to be a lucky man. Rather, more accurately was that I was lucky enough to have a roommate that decided to drop a bunch of money on a widescreen HDTV. That was awesome.\r\nSo the thing about televisions that bug me, however, is the remote. Like that remote for the television I was mentioning, it was really cool. It had a really sleek design that I thought complemented the set really well. The problem? The thing is useless unless you only watch basic cable. You want more than a handful of channels? Kiss your TV remote goodbye. Nope, you\'re stuck with the cable company\'s remote which, seemingly by rule, is hideous. Absolutely hideous.\r\nIt\'s like cable companies are completely lacking in any kind of artistic drive. It\'s not like it costs more money to make your remote suck less. I\'m not asking for features, I just want to be able to look at the thing without wanting to vomit.\r\nSo they\'re out. They\'ve had way too many chances to redeem themselves now. So check this: it\'s the Logitech Harmony 650. Not only does this thing control your cable, TV and pretty much anything else you want to throw at it, the thing looks freaking sweet. It even has its own screen. That\'s how cool this little device is. Throw the cluttered mass of 5 or 6 remotes you\'ve got spread out on your table and grab one of these things. Many parts of your life will increase in quality.Product Features:\r\nColorful command screen\r\nReplaces up to 5 remotes\r\nSupports 5000+ brands\r\nSimple online setup through PC\r\nOne-click activity buttons\r\nDevice database is updated everyday\r\nBacklit buttons\r\nContoured shape\r\nRequires 2 AA batteriesWhat You Get:\r\nLogitech Harmony 650 Remote\r\nUSB Cable\r\nFactory Recertified\r\n90 Day Warranty','$39.99'),(138,'Daily Steals Toys','http://toys.dailysteals.com/','http://toys.dailysteals.com/','http://toys.dailysteals.com/images/product/medium/1904.jpg','New Battery Operated Lilâ Rider Police Trike with Authentic-Style Motorcycle Lights - Choice of Black or Blue','','2011-08-08','You Couldn’t Hang in the Same Chuck E. Cheese as Me.\r\nI own a fantastic bicycle. It’s a ten speed and it gets me from point A from point B. I have a sweet helmet that I’ve glued neon reflectors to and let me tell you,These things will save your life when you’re riding on the Bronx-Queens expressway. You could say that I have it all.However, my bike is obsolete in the sense that it drives only 1/19th the speed of an automobile. \r\nI’ve been riding the same bike for years now and frequently encountered the same scenario: I pull up to a red light on a very busy street and I’m minding my own business, jamming out to The Best of Golden Earring on my minidisc player when all of a sudden some chump pulls up to the light in some lame sports car. I think to myself “Hey, you can beat this guy. He’s a nothing,a nobody, areject. He couldn’t hang in the same Chuck E Cheese as you. You have an amazing, hand-crafted 10 speed bicycle and he has a ‘BMW’ or a ‘Jaguar’. You will beat him.” \r\nJust like always I begin to nod my head and stare at the driver. “What are you looking at, you’re freaking me out.” they say. “I know”, I respond. “That’s the point. Let’s race”. It never happens. They always start laughing and drive away. It’s clearly just a defense mechanism because they know deep down inside that I would beat them; but still I need something that will give me a bit more pep on the drag strip. I need the Lil Rider Police Trike. Oh yes. The day will be mine.

Rubberwood trees are farmed \r\nextensively in Asia and are harvested for their latex each year, but by \r\nthe time they get to around 30 years old, latex yields decrease to the \r\npoint that its not commercially viable to tap the tree anymore. Until \r\nrecently, when trees reached this point, the were burned or chopped down\r\n for fire wood to make room for new planting.
