OBSCURE BLUESMAN INSPIRES A NEW GENERATION\r\nAugust 19th, 2011\r\n\r\nWith the imminent death of blues guitarist Robert \"Vintage\" Slim close on the horizon, several musicians, celebrities and public figures have come forward claiming to have always loved the obscure bluesman.\r\n\r\n\"Not a lot of people know this, but Vintage Slim has always been a hero of mine,\" said rap-metal vocalist Freddy Pro$ac, who obviously learned of the blues musician\'s existence only hours ago. \"You can hear his influence on a lot of the songs I write, especially \'Gotta Get Laid,\' and \'D-Bags.\' I hope he knows how much I love him.\"\r\n\r\nVintage Slim\'s poor health has also kick-started the production of unlicensed t-shirts, documentaries and even wristwatches inspired by the overlooked musician. The Invicta Watch Group, for instance, has began production on a line of fashionable Vintage Slim Collection timepieces featuring Swiss Ronda Quartz Movements and crocodile-embossed leather straps, regardless of the fact that not a single Invicta employee can name one of Vintage Slim\'s tunes. The cable channel MH1 also plans to revise their 100 Greatest Guitarists special to place Slim at the #1 spot, despite never before airing a single note of his music.\r\n\r\nShockingly, no one is more surprised by this news than the guitarist himself. \"Now that I\'m gonna meet my maker, everybody wanna call \'ol Vintage Slim an influence,\" says the bluesman, referring to himself in the third person. \"What I wanna know is, where were they 30 years ago, when Vintage was sleepin\' in a cardboard box and eatin\' outta trashcans on Beale Street? Huh? Where was they then?\"\r\n\r\nFor now, the music community can only await the moment of Slim\'s tragic death, presumably so they can be the first to tweet a heartfelt message to his loved ones and promptly forget about him altogether.','$59','','2011-08-19',204,NULL),(11,'http://jackrabbitdealoftheday.dodshops.com/','http://jackrabbitdealoftheday.dodshops.com//images/products/205/2010/04/6333.jpg','SEIKO S141 - 300 Lap Memory','» Dual memory mode (single memory   function or block memory function\r\n» Measurable up to 10 hours in 1/100 of a second\r\n» Split/lap time measurement\r\n» Store and recall of up to 300 split/lap times\r\n» Memory segregated by event\r\n» Multiple event memory\r\n» Memory recall during operation\r\n» Memory overflow warning\r\n» Measures strokes per minute for events such as swimming and rowing\r\n» Large-sized three row display panel\r\n» Time and automatic calendar\r\n» Battery life indicator\r\n» 10-bar water resistant','$180.00','','2011-08-19',207,NULL),(12,'http://www.jewelryshoppingclub.com/','http://www.jewelryshoppingclub.com/item/SN10170.jpg','Overlapping Circles Hematite and Black Diamond Swarovski Crystal Double Circle Pendant Necklace','Studded in sparkle, this fashionable flashy Double Circle shaped \r\nnecklace is sure to get you noticed.

Hector running  around the fence with his dadâs hose, water piercing through the sky, me  falling to the ground soaked and disheartened, and Hectorâs maniacal  cackling as he ran off with three GI JOE  figures I bought separately with my birthday money and a sweet Master  Chief Aunt Mary gave me for Christmas. And yet we know that the worst  images were the ones that were unseen to the neighborhood: the empty  seat in the battle cruiser. Nearly five action figures taken from us,  without warning.\r\nâCharlie, what are you on about?â\r\nToday, at my direction, the Johnson family launched an attack on  Hectorâs backyard to retake our action figures and neutralize Cobra  Commander. A small team of brave He-Man figures utilized a cutting edge  World Tech Toys Metal Mini Eagle GYRO RC Helicopter to fly in undetected. Mainly because Hector and his family were at the mall.\r\nThe helicopter, with its LED lights, IR  transmitter, and Metal Body with Detailed Paint Job, ferried our figures  in. After a brief laser rifle battle, Cobra Commander was subdued. Our  troops were returned home, where they will stay safely in my bedroom.  Weâve learned a valuable lesson about leaving our toys out in the yard.\r\nâCould you pass the salad?â\r\n        \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWarranty: 90 Days World Tech Toys\r\nCondition: New\r\nRecommended Ages: 8 and Up\r\nFeatures:\r\nSturdy metal body making it strong yet light weight so you donât  have  worry about breaking anything when you land it a bit too rough\r\n    The 3.5-channel control will allow you to go forward, backward, up, down, left, right and hover\r\n    Coaxial rotor and a single rear rotor for precise control\r\n    Built-in Gyroscope for stable controlled flights\r\n    Metal body with detailed paint job\r\n    Electric powered\r\n    IR transmitter\r\n    Charges off transmitter (requires 6 AA batteries not included)\r\n    LED lights\r\n    Easy & ready to fly\r\n    Watch it in action!\r\nAdditional Photos:\r\nCharging\r\n    LED Lights\r\n    Power Switch & Charging Port\r\n    Infrared Transmitter\r\n    Package Contents\r\n    Packaging\r\nSpecifications:\r\nMain Rotor Diameter: 7 inches\r\n    Length: 7.25 inches\r\n    Height: 4 inches\r\nBattery Requirements:\r\nVehicle: 3.7V 150mAh Li-Poly Rechargeable Battery (included)\r\n    Transmitter: 6 AA Alkaline Batteries (not included)\r\nIn the box:\r\nWorld Tech Toys ZX-34452 GYRO Mini Eagle 3.5-Channel RC Helicopter\r\n    IR Transmitter/Charger\r\n    (2) Spare Main Rotors\r\n    Spare Rear Rotor\r\n    Mini Screwdriver\r\n ','19.99','+ $5 shipping','2011-08-19',228,NULL),(32,'http://www.kindredcreationsideas.blogspot.com/','http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L2UHppamwG8/Tk3T-62dH9I/AAAAAAAABNY/WOh3Q6yHI7M/s400/Label%2BShapes%2BDigital%2Bset%2Bpreview.jpg','Label Shapes Digital Set','20 wonderful label shapes and frames.

The Les Paul Double Cutaway P-90 celebrates this popular model in a limited-edition guitar with special appointments. This limited run of instruments is available in three finishes: ebony, bullion gold and classic white with a dark back and neck.The Gibson Les Paul Double Cutaway\'s body woods present a combination of good clarity, definition and treble bite from the maple, and excellent depth and richness from the mahogany, all of which are elements that are found in the classic Les Paul Standard tone. This Gibson Les Paul guitar is crafted from a two-piece maple top and a chambered mahogany body. This wood combination, one of the most legendary pairs in the history of the solid and semi-solid electric guitar, yields a \"best of both worlds\" tonal splendor, while also producing a classic look and a sturdy instrument. The chambering adds a further dimension, increasing the complexity of this guitar\'s tone, while also increasing its acoustic volume and sustain.The neck of the Les Paul Double Cutaway is constructed from one solid piece of Grade-C mahogany, cut using the superior \"quarter sawn\" orientation for improved strength and resonance. This neck is carved to Gibson\'s slim-taper \'60s profile, which offers a fast, comfortable playing feel. It is carefully angled at Gibson\'s traditional 17 degrees, which increases pressure on the strings and helps them stay in the nut slots. The Gibson logo is inlaid in mother of pearl across the top of the headstock face with \"Les Paul Model\" silkscreened in gold along the center of the headstock.The Gibson Les Paul Double Cutaway sports 22 jumbo frets on a rosewood fingerboard that is adorned with acrylic trapezoidal inlays. The 12-inch radius or this fingerboard provides smooth note bending capabilities and eliminates \"dead\" or \"choked out\" notes. The headstock of the Les Paul Double Cutaway is equipped with vintage-style tuners with pearloid tulip buttons. These tuners provide a classic look in line with the Gibson guitar\'s lineage, and smooth, robust performance.This Les Paul Double Cutaway is equipped with dual Gibson P-90 pickups that offer a snappy, slightly gritty response, with a chunky midrange, firm lows, and sweet, musical highs. The P-90 was the standard pickup on all Gibson guitars in the late 1940s and into the 1950s and because of its crisp, bright tone it has experienced resurgence in popularity with many of today\'s modern rockers. In the bridge position, the P-90 packs plenty of snarly cutting power, while in the neck position it can be surprisingly rich and refined. You\'ll find that the P-90s\' high output and biting treble has more nuanced harmonic coloring than the typical single-coil pickup.A Gibson Tune-O-Matic bridge provides a firm seating for the strings, allowing the player to adjust and fine-tune the intonation and string height in a matter of minutes. It also yields excellent coupling between strings and body, maximizing resonance, tone, and sustain. A separate \"stopbar\" tailpiece, which is designed to further enhance the connection between the strings and the body.The Gibson Les Paul Double Cutaway comes protected in black hardshell Gibson guitar case.Full Details','$999.00','','2011-08-20',259,NULL),(54,'http://myblingspot.dodshops.com/','http://myblingspot.dodshops.com//images/products/38/2011/03/10893.jpg','Trendy 1\" Leather Bracelet with Turquoise and Crystal Studs','These fabulous 1\' Leather Bracelets are studded with Turquoise and Crystals.

I used to have a wet swiffer mop and other mops, but using the steam mop, I feel, gets the floors really clean and with the heat it\'s easier to clean and feel my floor is sanitized. \n\nPlus I made the mistake to use black grout with the tile in my basement. Every bit of dust shows on it. Before using this Steam Mop it was almost impossible to get it back to looking black.  \n\nWhat I have found to be the only downside is the way the handle is made. Do wish they would have made it more sturdy. It is a little flimsy and tends to wobble when mopping. But overall, it\'s a great cleaning mop.\n\nI almost forgot... if you are an Allergy sufferer, you are going to love this. It will clean and pick up things like nothing else.\n\nCompare this to the Shark Steam Machine in both quality and price and it simply can\'t keep up with the PROlectrix.

Another one is almost three-quarters  machine, allowing her to not only hack into any computer system in the  world, but perform feats of super-strength. Thereâs a married couple,  with a guy who controls the ground beneath your feet and a woman who  controls the air above your head. Thereâs even a nasty, hairy little  fellow whoâs been genetically enhanced to be part honey badger and  always ends his sentences with the word âBub.â\r\nYou are the member of Supergroup codenamed âComedic Product Placement Guy.â Guess what your superpower is.\r\nItâs not a bad gig, really. Mostly, you just find a decent place to  cower, let the heroes do their thing, wait for the dust to settle, and  smile pretty for the news crews that show up in the aftermath â just  make sure you work some pun about this weekâs product into the  interviews. The leotard isnât too uncomfortable and the payâs enough  that you can send your daughter to the private school your ex-wife  insists she goes to. If it wasnât for the incredible danger and constant  fear of death, youâd be pretty happy.\r\nLately, though, you canât help but feel things have gotten a little  tedious. Now, for instance, as you hide inside the SuperVan as the  battle rages outside, fumbling with Braun 190 Series 1 Menâs Shaver the  suits at HQ handed you before you all left on your latest adventure, you  canât help but feel kinda meh about the job. âMake sure you mention the  FreeFloatâ¢ System that lets the foil follow facial contours for a  smooth finish,â they told you. âWork in the easy cleaning, too. Oh, and  if you could throw the shaver to Electri-Leader at some point during the  battle and witty up something about the rechargeable and corded  operation, thereâll be a BIG bonus in it for  you.â Sure thereâs a bonus, if youâre not torn apart by tentacles or  vaporized by a laser beforehand. And didnât they just give you  an electric shaver to highlight two weeks ago? This one might be âfor  demanding beginners,â but thatâs not a lot to work with.\r\nKRA-KOOOOOOM! Oh, geez.  âKra-koomâ can only mean that victory for Supergroup is almost at hand.  Time to shake off the malaise and be funny for the reporters again. Try  leading with âThat was certainly a âclose shave.ââ Maybe the daughter  you only get to see once a month will get a chuckle out of it when she  sees you on TV.\r\n        \r\n \r\n\r\nWarranty: Braun 2 Year Limited\r\nCondition: New\r\nFeatures:\r\nSeries 1 is the perfect Braun shaver for demanding beginners\r\n    An ergonomic design and extra-wide shaver head give you an efficient shave\r\n    FreeFloatâ¢ System: Floating foil effortlessly follows facial contours for a smooth finish\r\n    Long hair trimmer allows controlled trimming of mustache and sideburns\r\n    Rechargeable and corded operation\r\n    Up to 30 minutes of cordless shaving\r\n    Automatic worldwide voltage adjustment\r\n    Fully washable under running tap water for easy cleaning\r\n    Ownerâs Manual\r\n\r\nAdditional Photos:\r\nTrimmer Raised\r\n    Front Profile\r\n    Back Profile\r\n    Package Contents\r\n    Packaging\r\n\r\nIn the box:\r\n(1) Braun 190 Series 1 Menâs Shaver\r\n    (1) Foil Protection Cap\r\n    (1) Charging Cord\r\n    (1) Cleaning Brush\r\n    (1) Appliance Oil','29.99','+ $5 shipping','2011-08-26',327,NULL),(100,'https://www.selloutz.com','http://www.selloutz.com/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/Electric____Tech_4db636a47a0e4.jpg','Electric - \"Tech XL\" Polarized Sunglasses - Men\'s:','ELECTRIC is a premium sunglass, snow goggle, and accessories company that has been rocking since 2000.

Sure, itâs been around in  one form or another for over 105 years. Sure, itâs helped people learn  about single tax theory and land grabbing. Sure, a special edition was  even made to help WWII prisoners of war escape from Nazi prisons. The gameâs got a long and storied history, but it canât change this one simple fact:\r\nMonopoly sucks.\r\nSeeing someone grab a Monopoly box from the closet full of games is  like hearing the judge issue your life sentence in prison. Your heart  sinks, you feel your stomach climb up into your throat, your eyes sting  with tears, and your mouth salivates in an attempt to lubricate itself  for the vomit you will soon be expelling.\r\nFrom then on itâs an endurance trial, as every time a Monopoly board  is unfolded from the box it generates a bubble of altered space-time  much like the event horizon of a black hole, where to outside observers  the players seem frozen in place forever. It is a documented fact that  the shortest game of Monopoly ever played lasted a âmereâ 42 hours.  Three people died from either dehydration, boredom-induced aneurysms, or  self-inflicted wounds made with a miniature top hat.\r\nYet somehow they continue to propagate this âgameâ throughout toy  stores everywhere. New editions come out, as if renaming Boardwalk with a  street from the Simpsons universe or your favorite NFL franchise would make constructing tenement housing and predatory rent prices more fun.\r\nYou want to know what a game of Monopoly is like? Imagine a tiny pewter boot stamping on a human face â forever.\r\nWear this shirt: While justifying another trip to McDonaldâs under the guise of âMAYBE THIS TIME IâLL GET THE BOARDWALK PIECE! ANOTHER 20-PC. CHICKEN NUGGET, PLEASE!â\r\nDonât wear this shirt: To game night at the local nerd hangout, unless you like cries of âWe play TABLE TOP GAMES, here, not your ridiculous board games!â\r\nThis shirt tells the world: âIâm going to marry  into your family and ruin every Thanksgiving and Christmas gathering for  the rest of your life by suggesting we all gather âround the table and  play this monstrosity.â\r\nWe call this color: I would rather grind my face off onto Asphalt than play this game\r\n        Design Placement: Centered\r\nDesign Size:\r\n3X â S: 14.00â x 5.29âWXL - WS:  10.50â x 3.97âK12 - K4:  9.00â x 3.40â\r\nPantone Color(s): White - Cool Grey 1C - Cool Grey 9C - 7499C - 7416C - 7472C\r\nPlease check our sizing chart before you order.

The Realtree® Reversible meets hunter orange requirements in all states and features a range of adjustability that assures a perfect fit over bulky winter hunting gear. Same great list of features you find in all HSS harnesses, with the added advantage of cross-season wear. The Realtree® reversible features new and improved Saddle-Style leg straps that distribute weight evenly across the body and legs, eliminating unnecessary pressure to the crotch area. This fast, secure system eliminates the need for dangling straps and weave through buckles that flap as you walk and interfere with the bow string at that critical moment. Includes new Suspension Relief technology* Now a standard on all Hunter Safety System® harnesses, suspension relief technology brings an added measure of safety in the event of a fall. *Suspension Relief Technology utilizes the HSS deer drag to relieve leg and chest pressure during recovery. By redesigning the deer drag strap included with every HSS harness, it now doubles as an added safety device. In the event of a fall, the strap is clipped to the lower D-ring on the back of the harness. To recover, the hunter places one foot in the loop on the end of the drag strap and stands up.

Is this not the way  with all things in this balancing act we call life?â\r\nâThe soul of the 2008 Sextant Central Coast Zinfandel is comprised  of robust berries including blueberry, raspberry, strawberry along with  pomegranate flavors and a kiss of chocolate. While the soul of this  motorcycle is engine parts. So now you can now understand why it is  easier to drink the wine than to drink the motorcycle.â\r\nâWhen working on a motorcycle it is impossible not to consider the  idea of âquality.â Who is it that determines what constitutes high  quality work? How does one reconcile differences in quality between two  completely different things whose paths cross? For example, look here at  all the things I have broken on this motorcycle. And look here at this  empty bottle of simply done yet elegant and classic Zin. How can it be  that my consumption of a quality wine has lessened the quality of the  motorcycle? And how am I going to explain this to Todd, whose motorcycle  it is?â\r\n        Sextant Wines Central Coast 2008 Zinfandel\r\nMalolactic Fermentation ~ 100%\r\n    Total Acidity ~ .56g\r\n    pH ~ 3.75\r\n    Residual Sugar ~ .19\r\n    Alcohol ~ 14.8%\r\n    BOTTLED: May 28, 2009\r\n    RELEASE DATE: June 1, 2010\r\n    APPELLATION: Central Coast\r\n    COMPOSITION: 82% Zinfandel (Primativo 03, UCD 06), 9% Petite Sirah (UCD 03),  6% Syrah (ENTAV 877), 3% Mourvedre (ENTAV 369)\r\nIntense black cherry hues partner with a bouquet of vanilla, wild  strawberries, sweet baked rhubarb and the complexity of subtle herbs as  youâre invited in to discover more.
